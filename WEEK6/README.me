DTD Validation:

Ensure bookstore.xml and bookstore.dtd are in the same directory.

Install xmllint (if not already):

sudo apt-get install libxml2-utils      # Debian/Ubuntu
# or brew install libxml2                # macOS with Homebrew

Run:

xmllint --noout --dtdvalid bookstore.dtd bookstore.xml

A successful validation prints nothing; errors report line numbers and issues.

XSD Validation:

Ensure bookstore.xml and bookstore.xsd are together.

Edit bookstore.xml to reference the schema: replace the <!DOCTYPE...> line with:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<bookstore xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
           xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="bookstore.xsd">

and close with </bookstore> (no DOCTYPE).

Run:

xmllint --noout --schema bookstore.xsd bookstore.xml

Alternatively, in Java, use Xerces:

java -jar xercesImpl.jar -f bookstore.xml -noregistry -validate

IDE/Editor Validation:

Visual Studio Code: Install the "XML Tools" extension; open bookstore.xml, and it will highlight DTD/XSD errors.

Oxygen XML Editor or Altova XMLSpy: Open the XML, assign the DTD/XSD, and run their validation commands.

With these steps, you can run both DTD and XSD validations and inspect any structural or type errors in your Bookstore XML.
